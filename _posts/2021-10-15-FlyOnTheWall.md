  The “Fly on the Wall” lab was a great way of taking advantage of our everyday environment, and how typical Horace Mann students do not notice every little detail around us as we go along with our busy days. There is an infinite amount of observations a person could make about anything that they see, but my partner Specifically, I observed the nature around me. My partner and I enjoyed the last days of summer as we head into fall - how did other students also take advantage of nature at school and how lucky we are to have outdoor space? Many people were sitting on the grass in many interesting configurations. Something I noted was that there were circles of people, with groups of 2 within the circle. Also, the people we observed were mostly in our own grade, so there was a possible bias of being familiar with most of these people. It is also the same with objects! We noticed new things in the basement floor of Tillinghast, where the App Development Class is. The vending machine has snacks again (the most important observation)! 
 

  My main observations from wandering around school brought up some ideas about how we, as students, could figure out a way to make the school a better place. To group some observations, I notices a lot of them were about the enviornment of school - one of them, for example, the way the school is situated as a whole. The day my parter and I were walking around school, it was a little chillier than anticipated, so we were kind of cold! I thought about a way that the school could all be connected while staying inside. When it is raining, we would always be covered, when it is cold, and when it is too hot. Also, another group of information my partner and i noticed was about the social aspects. People were clumped up, and not many people from different grades were talking to each other! Another social observation was that some people were playing sports and others were not - but everyone playing sports were boys. There could be a good way at school for people to integrate together to create a more inclusive enviornment.
  
  Lastly, when being a "fly on the wall' I walked around the school with my partner and picked up many observations that I had not noticed before. Being super aware as to what I was doing what important, because it could have been very easy to miss something. Something that could have gine better in this lab was that my observations were mainly about people who I am familiar with - maybe if I had gone to another area to where some middle schoolers were, I would have noticed some differences between how I was in middle school and how they interact with one another.
