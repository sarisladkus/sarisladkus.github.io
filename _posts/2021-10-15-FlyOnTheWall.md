The “Fly on the Wall” lab was a great way of taking advantage of our everyday environment, and how typical Horace Mann students do not notice every little detail around us as we go along with our busy days. Specifically, I observed the nature around me. My partner and I enjoyed the last days of summer as we head into fall - how did other students also take advantage of nature at school and how lucky we are to have outdoor space? Many people were sitting on the grass in many interesting configurations. Something I noted was that there were circles of people, with groups of 2 within the circle. Also, the people we observed were mostly in our own grade, so there was a possible bias of being familiar with most of these people. It is also the same with objects! We noticed new things in the basement floor of Tillinghast, where the App Development Class is. The vending machine has snacks again (the most important observation)!
