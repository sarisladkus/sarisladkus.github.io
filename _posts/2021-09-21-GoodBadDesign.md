Due before class meets Thursday, September 23
Find two examples of design – one good and one bad. The examples should be in tech but can be software or something physical in society. For each example, take a screenshot of the part of the design that you are evaluating (if you are writing about something that is not software, find an image of the product/design) and write a short paragraph (4-6 sentences) explaining what about that design is either good or bad. Publish your write-up as a post on your website with the title “Good vs. Bad Design”. The screenshot/image that you use should appear in the post with the description of each image appearing below the image.

Good Design Example:

The Apple Watch is an outstanding design because it is sleek and stylish, while also being highly functional. Its industrial design makes it super easy to find what is needed, which is also linked to the discoverability, making it super easy to use for all age groups. The back of the watch has a sensor to measure heart rate and movement of the body.
