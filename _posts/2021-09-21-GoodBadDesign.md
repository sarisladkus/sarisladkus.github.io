Due before class meets Thursday, September 23
Find two examples of design – one good and one bad. The examples should be in tech but can be software or something physical in society. For each example, take a screenshot of the part of the design that you are evaluating (if you are writing about something that is not software, find an image of the product/design) and write a short paragraph (4-6 sentences) explaining what about that design is either good or bad. Publish your write-up as a post on your website with the title “Good vs. Bad Design”. The screenshot/image that you use should appear in the post with the description of each image appearing below the image.

Good Design Example:

The Apple Watch is an outstanding design because it is sleek and stylish, while also being highly functional. Its **industrial design** makes it super easy to find what is needed, which is also linked to the **discoverability**, making it super easy to use for all age groups. The back of the watch has a sensor to measure heart rate and movement of the body. It can also be regularly updated by Apple so the owner is able to keep up with bug fixes without having to purchase a new watch.


Bad Design Example:

This is VERY specific, but the NYU Langone app that I have to use to keep in contact with one of my doctors is so poorly designed for many reasons. First off, it is mapped out horribly and is so difficult to navigate. Each button is very misleading and takes the user to another page that seemingly has nothing to do with what was wanted. It always takes me at least 5 minutes to find one tab that should take a person 2 seconds. Its **interaction design** was not well-thought out!
