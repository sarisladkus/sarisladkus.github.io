Within the Horace Mann Community, I find that every day I notice the mess that the students make with lunch and food consumption throughout the day. I see empty plates, half-full plates, open water bottles, and more scattered everyone one might walk. The mess can even be in the weirdest places simply because students are too lazy to walk 5-feet to the closest garbage bin. There also is not a distinct lunch period for every student, so the mess is really scattered and accumulates throughout the day. It is also super uncomfortable for students who have to eat later in the day. This problem really bothers me - we are all super privileged children to have the ability to go to an amazing school like Horace Mann, and we are all perfectly capable of cleaning up after ourselves. I also do not believe it is the job of the Flik and cleaning staff to clean up after students’ food because they already have the hefty job of cooking, cleaning, and preparing food for thousands of students in the Middle and Upper Divisions. 
There could be many important initiatives in the Horace Mann community that could help fix these problems that fall within the theme of “community engagement and action” that students could come up with in the future. These solutions could also solve other issues that could easily come up at school -- for example, the general messiness left in classrooms outside of the lunch blocks during C, D, E, F and G periods. Many students just assume that the next class or the janitorial staff will clean up those messes too. These messy areas in classrooms take away from class time and can create a distraction.
